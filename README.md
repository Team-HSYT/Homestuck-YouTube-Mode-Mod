# Homestuck YouTube Mode [Mod]
This is a Homestuck mod for The Unofficial Homestuck Collection. The purpose of this mod is to optimize Homestuck for Let's Reads on YouTube. It does the following:

Plays music as you read (unlocks on page 440) (Optional)

Warns you about easy-to-miss things

Translates "encoded" text (Morse Code, etc.)

Restores an unused music track (One page of the original Homestuck has a song made for it, but it was left unused for unknown reasons. The song was replaced by silence. This mod puts the song back.)

Explains a few interesting fun facts

Shows a certain piece of fanwork ([S]RDA)

Gives a YouTube channel a shoutout on the Homestuck subreddit (three times: near the beginning, near the middle and near the end)

Warns  about long segments and lets the reader know it would be a good time to end the episode

Warns about copyrighted music

Removes slurs (The original Homestuck contains 58 instances of the R slur and 2 instances of the F slur - assuming we didn't miss some. This mod replaces them with other words. We cannot guarantee we caught them all, however.)
